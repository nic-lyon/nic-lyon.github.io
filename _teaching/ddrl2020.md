Course Description:
"This course, like the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law (CDDRL) itself, is devoted to exploring the links between various components of democracy, development, and the rule of law. We will examine the causal relationships (if there are any) between political institutions and economic development, both historically and comparatively in different regions of the world. We will ask: What effects do variations in the quality of institutions have on political and economic outcomes? How are the institutions of democracy and effective governance built in conflict-ridden countries? Do historical and cultural legacies such as communism, agrarian-based economies, or religion influence the emergence of democratic institutions? Are autocracies better than democracies in generating economic growth? Is there a universal set of ideas or models that the international policy community might use to promote democracy and development? Should the United States endeavor to do either?"
