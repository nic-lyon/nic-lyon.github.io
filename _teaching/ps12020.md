Course Description:
"This course is an introduction to the systematic study of politics. We will use the tools of political science to investigate four major challenges: order, governance, diversity, and inequality. Students will gain a deeper understanding of these challenges and what might be done to address them. As we study order, governance, diversity, and inequality, we will introduce key concepts and methods in the field of political science. Students will learn how political scientists build theories, generate hypotheses, and test hypotheses with quantitative and qualitative data. Students will have opportunities to apply their knowledge in several ways. They will critique scientific research; propose and test original hypotheses; and use theory and evidence from the class as a basis for making policy recommendations. The course will lay a foundation for more advanced study, and for careers in a wide variety of fields."
